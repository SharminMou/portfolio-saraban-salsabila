### System Components
- **Arduino Board**: Processes sensor inputs and controls outputs like the stepper motor, fan, and relay.
- **MQ-2 Smoke Sensor**: Monitors smoke concentration and sends analog signals to the Arduino.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors room temperature.
- **Stepper Motor**: Controls the opening and closing of a ventilation window located at the top of the room.
- **Bulb**: Simulates heat generation to test the systemâ€™s response.
- **Fan**: Expels smoke and heat efficiently.
- **Relay Module**: Controls fan and bulb operation.
- **Breadboard**: Used for circuit assembly.

### Working Mechanism
#### Data Collection
- Sensors continuously monitor smoke levels and room temperature.

#### Dynamic Bulb and Fan Control
- The bulb simulates heat, turning off when the temperature exceeds a set threshold.
- The fan activates to reduce room temperature and switches off when the room cools.

#### Ventilation Activation
- If temperature or smoke exceeds thresholds, the Arduino triggers the stepper motor to open the ventilation window.

#### Innovative Room Design
- The sloped roof ensures smooth airflow, rapidly expelling smoke and heat.

#### Real-Time Visualization
- LabVIEW 2021 provides a graphical interface for real-time monitoring of sensor data and system actions.
